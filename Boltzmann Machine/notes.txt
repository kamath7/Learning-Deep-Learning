Boltzmann Machines used for Recommendation Systems and fall under Unsupervised Learning

Boltzmann machines have hidden nodes (hidden layer) and visible nodes (input layer).
No output layer present. Everything is just connected to each other and there are no connections. They are bidirectional

Boltzmann machines different from other algorithms. They don't just expect input data but rather generate data. For Boltzmann machines all nodes are same (hidden and input). The entire boltzmann machine is a system and it generates a state
The BMs learn from the feeding data after which it learns on it own after seeing it. 

Energy Based Models -
Boltzmann distribution talks about probability. There is a formula
The higher the energy of a certain state lower the probability. 

Restricted Boltzmann Machines

Example taken is for Movies Recommendation
6 movies taken. Boltzmann machine trained. Boltzmann machine learns to assign it's nodes 
Input Nodes - Movies 
Hidden Nodes identify important features such as Genre A, Genre B, Actor X. 
RBMs understands the features common and identifies it as important 

Ex - Drama, Action, Dicaprio, Oscar, Tarantino - Important features  identified 

Contrastive divergence 

Undirected network and weights need to be updated
Gibbs network is used. 
Energy Curve - Weights determine the energy curve

Deep Belief Network 

Stacking RBMs on top of each other. Hidden layer of RBM1 will be ip of RBM2 and so on. 

Deep Boltzmann Machines

Main difference between DBN and DBM is the DBM is not deprived of the connectivity
