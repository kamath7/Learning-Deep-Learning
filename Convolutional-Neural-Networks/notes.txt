What is CNN - 
Brain looks at features and classifies it accordingly
Yann Le Cunn father of CNN

High Level CNN Overview - 
Input Image -> CNN -> Output Image class 

Take B&w image and COlor Image of 2 * 2 pixels 

Neural Networks takes the B&W image as a 2D array. Each of the pixel has a value between 0 and 255 (Intensity of color)
The Color Image is a 3D Layer (R, G and B Layer). Each pixel again has a value between 0 and 255

Image can be represented in a table manner where 0 would be black and 1 would be white. 

Steps followed
a) Convolution
b) Max Pooling
c) Flattening
d) Full Connection
