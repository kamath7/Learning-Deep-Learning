Components in ANN:

Neuron:

Body of the Neuron
Dendrites
Axon

Neuron on it's own is not that strong. Lots of neuron work together to create magic

Dendrites receive signal. Connected to axon of other neuron
Axon transmit signal. Connected to dendrite of another neuron

Synapses - Where the signal is passed between two neurons

Neuron gets input signal and has an output signal 
Input signals are represented by other neurons 

Input layer - Is senses in the human body. Feel, smell, see, hear.

Input layer passes signal/data through synpase to the hidden layer neuron. Input values are independent variable1. These input values are for one row say in a database. These variables need to be standardised or be normalised

Output value can be continous (price), binary (will exit yes/no) or categorical. Output value will also be for the same observation

Synapses are assigned weights. Weights are crucial for functioning. Weights are how NNs learn by adjusting weights to understand what signal is important or not. E.g. Gradient Descent and Backpropogation

Inside the hidden neuron layer - A weighted sum of the input values * weight is done. An activation function is applied. From that the neuron understands if a signal is to be passed or not. 


The Activation Function:

4 different types of activation function (predominant ones): a) Threshold function: Simple function. If value < 0 then the threshold function passes 0 else passes 1
b) Sigmoid Function: There's a formula. 1/(1+e^-x). Used in logistic regression. Much smoother than threshold function. Gradual progression. Used for predicting probabilities. Also between 0 and 1
c) Rectifier Function: Popular for ANN. Goes from 0 to 1. 
d) Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh): Similar to sigmoid. It goes below from 0 to -1. There's a formula for the hyperbolic tangent. 


Combination - Rectifier used in Hidden Layer and Sigmoid used at the output layer for predicting probability
