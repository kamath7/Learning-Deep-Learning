Recurrent Neural Networks - RNN 

Supervised Learning - Artificial Neural Networks (Used for Regression and classification )
Convolutional Neural Network (COmputer vision)
Recurrent Neural Network (Time Series Analysis)

Unsupervised Learning 
Self Organising Maps (Feature Detection)
Deep Boltzmann Machines (Recommendation Systems)
Auto Encoders (Recommendation Systems)

Human brain - cerebrum, cerebellum ,brainstem

Cerebrum - Frontal Lobe, Pareital Lobe, Occipital Lobe, Temporal Lobe
Weights are long term memory of ANN. Which is what the Temporal lobe in the brain does. Temporal lobe responsible for long term memory

CNN - Occipital Lobe 
RNN - Short term memory. What happened in the previous terms and what is going to happen. Frontal lobe in the brain.

For RNN the neurons still exist. 
The hidden layer has a temporal loop. The hidden layer feeds back into itself 

The next network remembers the previous calculations.

One to many output - Black and white dog jumps over bar (Computer Image fed into a RNN )
Many to one output - Sentiment analysis (Analysing a positive/negative comment)
Many to many output - Grammar translations in translation software (Short term info about the previous word for the next word)
Many to Many also has subtitles in a movie. 
Sunspring written by RNN
