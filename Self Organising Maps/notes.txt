Self Organising Maps

Self Organising Maps are used for feature detection and fall under Unsupervised Version

Teuvo Kohonen - Person who created SOM

Used to reduce dimensions

A multi dimensional dataset is taken and the dimensionality is reduced. A map is produced. Used to reduce the amount of columns

K-Means which does clustering would aid in Self Organising Maps 

K-Means clustering - 
Dataset plotted would undergo the K-Means algorithm giving us clustered 

Step1 - The number of clusters 'k' is chosen 
Step2 - Select at random K point, which are the centroids from the cluster 
Step3 - Assign each data point to the closest centroid that forms K clusters 
Step4 - Compute and place the new centroid of each cluster 
Step5 - Reassign each data point to the closest centroid. if any reassignent took place, go to step 4 otherwise finish

For assigning data point - euclidean distance is something that can be used
